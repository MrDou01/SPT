        A software for classifying earthquake sand liquefaction risk index based on standard penetration test
        A professional tool for seismic sand liquefaction index calculation and classification based on Standard Penetration Test data.

        I. Overview
        This software provides a user-friendly interface for calculating soil liquefaction potential using standard penetration test (SPT) data. It follows the procedures outlined in "SPT-Liquefaction Classification.docx" to compute the Liquefaction Index (ILE) and determine liquefaction classification.

        The application supports both manual data entry and batch processing through Excel table import, making it suitable for both individual site analysis and large-scale geotechnical investigations.

        II. Features
        1. Dual Input Modes: Supports both manual data entry and Excel table import
        2. Batch Processing: Calculate liquefaction potential for multiple points simultaneously
        3.Automatic Column Recognition: Intelligent identification of common column name formats in imported tables
        4. Comprehensive Results: Displays liquefaction index, classification, and corresponding anti-liquefaction measures
        5. Visualization: Graphical representation of safety factor distribution across soil layers
        6. Multi-point Management: Efficiently manage and analyze data from multiple measurement points
        7. Help Documentation: Built-in explanations of parameters, standards, and usage guidelines

        III. Installation
        Prerequisites
        1. Python 3.7 or higher
        2. Required packages:
        tkinter (usually included with Python)
        pandas
        matplotlib

        IV. Usage Guide

        Manual Input Mode
        1.Navigate to the "Manual Input" tab
        2. Enter basic parameters:
        Seismic Intensity (7/8/9 degrees)
        Discrimination Depth (15m or 20m)
        Groundwater Level Depth (dw)
        3. Add soil layer data with:
        Saturated soil depth (ds)
        Measured N-value
        Layer thickness (di)
        Use "Add Soil Layer" or "Delete Last Layer" to adjust the number of layers
        4. Click "Calculate" to view results

        Batch Processing with Table Import
        1. Navigate to the "Table Import" tab
        2. Click "Browse Files" to select an Excel file containing your data
        3. Verify column identification results (software automatically matches common column name formats)
        4. Set calculation parameters (same as manual input)
        5. Choose between:
        "Calculate Selected Point" to analyze a single point
        "Calculate All Points" to process all imported points simultaneously
        6. View results in the "Calculation Results" tab

        Managing Multiple Points
        1. Use "Add Point" and "Delete Point" in Manual Input mode to manage multiple measurement points
        2. Switch between points using the dropdown menu
        3. All results are automatically saved and accessible in the Results tab

         V. Calculation Methodology
        The software follows these key steps to determine liquefaction potential:

        1. Calculate Critical SPT Value (Ncr):
        Considers saturated soil depth and groundwater level
        Uses reference values based on seismic intensity (N0)

        2. Compute Safety Factor (FS):
        Ratio of measured N-value to critical Ncr

        3. Determine Liquefaction Index (ILE):
        Weighted sum of contributions from each soil layer
        Incorporates layer thickness and depth-dependent weighting factors

        4. Classify Liquefaction Potential:
        Based on ILE values and selected discrimination depth:
        For 15m depth: Slight (0<ILE≤5), Moderate (5<ILE≤15), Severe (ILE>15)
        For 20m depth: Slight (0<ILE≤6), Moderate (6<ILE≤18), Severe (ILE>18)
